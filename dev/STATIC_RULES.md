## UI/UX Consistency

- Use Material UI standards across the website: Material Icons, spacing, button style, and component appearance for a consistent, modern look.
- Use Material UI icons (Material Icons CDN) for all icons throughout the website for consistency and modern appearance.
- **Theme Policy**: The site is dark-mode only. Do not implement or re-enable any light theme or theme toggles. Ensure `<body>` has `dark-mode` class and never `light-mode`.
- **Button Contrast**: All buttons must have sufficient color contrast for accessibility. Primary buttons use white text on blue background with text shadows for enhanced readability.
- **Glass Effects**: Use the `.mui-glass` utility for translucent navigation and headers with backdrop blur.
- **Full-bleed Heroes**: Hero sections should use `.mui-hero--bleed` for full viewport width with gradient backgrounds.

## Best Practices

1. Keep legal/policy pages up to date in each company/branch folder. Remove legacy HTML; use Markdown only.
2. Set up and maintain automated checks for broken links in the Jekyll build process (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. Linting is optional. Hybrid Markdown/HTML is allowed for interactive calculators and advanced layouts. No markdownlint or pre-commit hook is required.
4. Add onboarding notes for new contributors in the `dev/` folder.
5. Periodically review navigation and company structure for consistency.
6. Use Jekyll data files for company details and navigation wherever possible for maintainability.
7. Document the process for adding a new company/branch (step-by-step guide).
8. Add a changelog or release notes file for major updates.
9. **CI Caching**: Use CI caching in GitHub Actions workflows to speed up builds and reduce dependency download times.
10. README Maintenance: Keep the `README.md` up to date with structure, navigation, and usage instructions.
11. Jekyll Data Access: When accessing data from Jekyll data files (e.g., `_data/companies.yml`), always use dot notation in Liquid assign statements (e.g., `{% assign details = site.data.companies.rk-oxygen.main %}`).

## Static Web Page Rules for This Repository

This repository is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, fully managed by Jekyll.
Please follow these rules:

1. **Static Content Only**: Only static files (Markdown, HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) are allowed. No server-side code or dynamic backend is supported.
2. **Jekyll Structure**: Organize files and folders using Jekyll conventions (`_layouts`, `_includes`, `_data`, etc.) so all public-facing pages and assets are accessible via GitHub Pages URLs.
3. **No Legacy HTML**: All content must be in Markdown (`.md`) or Jekyll-supported formats. Do not add or restore `.html` files for main content pages.
4. **No Build Step Required**: All files should be ready to serve as-is. GitHub Pages will build Jekyll sites automatically.
5. **Legal & Policy Pages**: Place legal documents (e.g., Terms, Refund Policy) under the appropriate company/branch folder (e.g., `companies/rk-oxygen/gorakhpur/terms.md`).
6. **Navigation**: All navigation, sidebar, and footer links should be managed in `_data/navigation.yml` and included via Jekyll layouts and includes. The navigation bar, sidebar, and footer are single-source-of-truth includes for the entire site. Sidebar must show all subpages for the current company/branch.
7. **Report Issue**: Every page must have a "Report Issue" button linking to the GitHub issues page.
8. **No Sensitive Data**: Do not include any private or sensitive information in the repository.
9. **README Maintenance**: Keep the `README.md` up to date with structure, navigation, and usage instructions.
10. **Jekyll Data Access**: When accessing data from Jekyll data files (e.g., `_data/companies.yml`), always use dot notation in Liquid assign statements (e.g., `{% assign details = site.data.companies.rk-oxygen.main %}`).

## Hybrid Content Policy

Hybrid Markdown/HTML is allowed for interactive calculators and advanced layouts (e.g., see `Calc/LIQ/index.md`). Linting is not enforced. All content must remain static and compatible with GitHub Pages/Jekyll.

## Directory Scaffolding Rules

To support multiple companies and branches, use the following directory structure:

- All company-specific content must be placed under the `companies/` directory.
- Each company has its own folder, e.g., `companies/rk-oxygen/`.
- Each branch/location of a company has its own subfolder, e.g.,
  `companies/rk-oxygen/gorakhpur/`.
- Legal and policy pages (e.g., `terms.md`, `refund-policy.md`) must be placed inside
  the relevant branch folder.
- Each branch folder should have its own `index.md` as a landing page.
- Do not use legacy folders (such as `rkoxygengkp`) for new content.

Example:

```text
companies/
  rk-oxygen/
   gorakhpur/
    index.md
    terms.md
    refund-policy.md
   lucknow/
    index.md
    terms.md
    refund-policy.md
```


## UI & Navigation Rules

- No static HTML main pagesâ€”use only Jekyll Markdown for all company/branch landing pages.
- Sidebar and topbar must be visually aligned; avoid extra spacers or mismatched offsets.
- Dropdowns for companies must list all major branches as separate options if needed.

This ensures clear separation and maintainability for all company and branch content.

## CI/CD and Quality Assurance

- **GitHub Actions**: All workflows use `npx --yes` for Node tools to avoid package.json dependencies
- **Lighthouse CI**: Performance and accessibility checks run on key pages via `lighthouserc.json`
- **axe-core**: Automated accessibility testing across all major pages
- **Link Checking**: Automated Markdown link validation on push/PR
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file, YAML validation, and large file checks
- **NPM Configuration**: Environment variables suppress deprecation warnings in CI workflows

## Development Workflow

- **Local Testing Required**: Use `.\test-and-push.ps1 "commit message"` for all changes
- **Git Workflow**: Always pull before committing to prevent conflicts
- **Testing Scripts**:
  - `scripts/test-before-push.ps1` - Comprehensive local testing that mirrors CI
  - `test-and-push.ps1` - Convenience wrapper for test-commit-push workflow
- **Requirements**: Ruby with Bundler (Jekyll), Node.js with npm (performance tools)
- **Quality Gates**: All changes must pass Jekyll build, basic accessibility, and link validation locally

This repository is for a static website only and is designed for deployment via GitHub
Pages with comprehensive quality assurance.
