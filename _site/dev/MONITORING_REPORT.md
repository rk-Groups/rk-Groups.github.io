- [ ] Check `a11y-and-lh.yml` for NPM warning suppression and Lighthouse scores
- [ ] Confirm no workflow failures or errors
- [ ] Test button contrast fix on live site pages

### ⚡ **Performance Validation** (Next 15-30 minutes)
- [ ] **Homepage**: Load time, hero section, navigation dropdowns
- [ ] **Companies**: Company cards, branch navigation, policy links
- [ ] **Calculators**: GST calc functionality, mobile responsiveness
- [ ] **Branch Pages**: Contact info display, policy access
- [ ] Check accessibility with browser dev tools on key pages

### 📊 **Ongoing Monitoring** (Daily/Weekly)
- [ ] Check workflow status before major pushes
- [ ] Monitor Lighthouse scores for performance regression on core pages
- [ ] Review accessibility reports for compliance across all company pages
- [ ] Validate calculator functionality and mobile UX

- Test failures in `a11y-and-lh.yml` on critical pages (home, companies, calculators)
- Link check failures (especially company → branch → policy chains)
- Any red ❌ status in Actions tab

### ⚠️ **Warning Signs**
- Lighthouse scores dropping below 90 on homepage or company pages
- Accessibility violations in axe-core reports (WCAG compliance issues)

- **Lighthouse Fails**: Check for performance regressions, optimize images, review calculator scripts
- **Links Fail**: Validate internal link structure, especially new company/branch relationships
- **Calculator Issues**: Test JavaScript functionality, validate form inputs
- **Policy Compliance**: Ensure all required branch policies are present and accessible
