## Overview

This is the official website for RK Oxygen, now powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages. All navigation, layout, and content are managed using Jekyll layouts, includes, and Markdown/HTML files for maintainability and consistency.

## Features
- **Company Navigation**: Topbar features a "Companies" dropdown for fast switching. Sidebar shows all subpages for the current company/branch.
- **Liquid Oxygen Converter**: Instantly convert between kilograms, tons, standard metric cubes (smÂ³), liters, and cylinders on the homepage.
- **GST Calculator**: Located at [`Calc/GST/index.md`](Calc/GST/index.md)
- **Liquid Calculator**: Located at [`Calc/LIQ/index.md`](Calc/LIQ/index.md)
- **Jekyll Layouts & Includes**: All pages use a single, shared layout (`_layouts/default.html`) and navigation components (`_includes/topbar.html`, `sidebar.html`, `bottombar.html`).
- **Navigation Data**: All navigation links and sidebar structure are managed in `_data/navigation.yml` for easy global updates.
- **Legal & Policy Pages**: Terms and refund policy are accessible from the navigation bar and sidebar for every company/branch.
- **Development Docs**: [TODOs](dev/TODO.md), [Completed Tasks](dev/COMPLETED.md), and [Static Rules](dev/STATIC_RULES.md) are now in the `dev/` folder.
- **Report Issue**: Every page has a "Report Issue" button linking to the GitHub issues page.

All navigation and footer links are generated from `_data/navigation.yml` and included via Jekyll's layout system. The navigation bar, sidebar, and footer are single-source-of-truth includes for the entire site.
