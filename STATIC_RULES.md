# Static Web Page Rules for This Repository

This repository is intended for use as a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. Please follow these rules:


1. **Static Content Only**: Only static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) are allowed. No server-side code or dynamic backend is supported.
2. **GitHub Pages Structure**: Organize files and folders so that all public-facing pages and assets are accessible via GitHub Pages URLs.
3. **No Build Step Required**: All files should be ready to serve as-is. Do not require any build tools or compilation.
4. **Legal & Policy Pages**: Place legal documents (e.g., Terms, Refund Policy) in the correct folders for direct linking.
5. **Navigation**: All navigation and footer links should use the centralized `site-links.js` system. Use the provided nav-* classes (e.g., `nav-home`, `nav-terms`) in HTML, and update links in `site-links.js` for global changes.
6. **No Sensitive Data**: Do not include any private or sensitive information in the repository.
7. **README Maintenance**: Keep the README.md up to date with structure, navigation, and usage instructions.
